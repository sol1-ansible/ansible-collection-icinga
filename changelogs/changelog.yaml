  0.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Added block rescue statement if unsupported os found. (#232)
      - Adjusted the way variables get looked up from `vars['varname']` to `varname`
        in most places.
      - Certain values within Icinga Web :code:`ini` files got quoted incorrectly
        using single quotes. They are now quoted properly using double quotes (#301).
      - Changed variable lookups in the form of `vars['variablename']` to `variablename`
        to avoid explicitly looking up the `vars` key of a play.
      - Fix bug where the port for Icinga Web's own database connection was not set
        in ``resources.ini``.
      - Fix bug with current beta release of Ansible Core where ``XY is dict`` does
        not work for dictionary-like variables. Use ``isinstance(XY, dict)`` now instead.
        This bug is related to the ``prefix`` filter plugin but might arise again
        with other parts of the code in the future.
      - Fix exposure of secret ``TicketSalt`` inside the API feature. Use constant
        ``TicketSalt`` as the value for ``ticket_salt`` instead which is an empty
        string if unchanged by the user.
      - 'Fix quoting for ! in templating Issue #208'
      - Fix templating issue where explicitly quoting integer values for use as strings
        is necessary in certain versions of e.g. Jinja2 - thanks @sol1-matt
      - Fixed a bug in :code:`monitoring_plugins` where a requested plugin that is
        **unavailable** would cause a failure even though it is a **known** plugin
        and should be skipped (#327).
      - Fixed collect of icinga2_objects when icinga2_config_host is not defined (#228)
      - Fixed incorrect failure of x509 variable sanity checks. They now fail as intended
        instead of due to syntax (#303).
      - Fixed wrong variable being referenced to apply x509 mysql database schema.
        Use `schema_path_mysql` now (#303).
      - Icinga's packages no longer create '/var/log/icingadb-redis/'. Added tasks
        that create a log directory based on `icingadb_redis_logfile` (#298).
      - 'Icinga2: Correctly rename cleanup argument from icinga2_ca_host_port to ca_host_port'
      - 'Icingaweb2: Change order of module state and configuration tasks #225'
      - 'Reintroduce file deleted in previous PR #354 to restore functionality in
        x509 module - thanks to @lutin-malin #366'
      - Replaced quote filter from ini template
      - The Icinga DB config template used two different variables to configure (in)secure
        TLS communication with the database. It now uses :code:`icingadb_database_tls_insecure`
        for both the condition and as the actual value (#302).
      - The type of :code:`vars['icinga2_objects']` was wrongly tested for. This should
        be a list. The type is now `properly checked <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_tests.html#type-tests>`_
        for (#308).
      - When using :code:`icinga2_custom_config` sub directories within the found
        :code:`files/` directory can now be used to deploy Icinga 2 configuration.
        This allows users to freely structure their :code:`files/` directory (nested
        directories) (#309).
      - fixed libboost_regex1_54_0 missing for Suse 12. thanks @dh-roland
      - 'icingaweb2: run pqslcmd with LANG=C to ensure the output is in english.'
      - remove superfluous curly brace (#246)
      major_changes:
      - Add an Ansible Inventory Plugin to fetch host information from Icinga 2's
        API for use as an Ansible Inventory
      - Added Installation of x509 certificate monitoring model
      minor_changes:
      - Add object :code:`CompatLogger` and feature :code:`compatlog`.
      - Add support for Suse in the :code:`monitoring_plugins` role.
      - Add the ability to create additional Icinga Web 2 users - Thanks @losten-git
      - Add variable `icinga_monitoring_plugins_dependency_repos` to allow for later
        modification by the user if specific other repositories need to be activated
        instead of `powertools` / `crb`
      - Added support for PostgresQL databases for Icingaweb2 modules that support
        it
      - Added tests for retention configs
      - Allow for usage of loop variables from :code:`apply_for` within object - Thanks
        @lucagubler (#344)
      - Change documentation to better reflect the intended usage of the variable
        'icinga2_objects' as a host variable vs. as a play variable.
      - 'Enhance IcingaDB retention configs #200'
      - 'Icingaweb2: fix duplicate task name at kickstart tasks (#244)'
      - added pyinilint as ini validator after templates
      - added tests for icingaweb2 ini template
      - changed all references of "vars['icingaweb2_modules']" to "icingaweb2_modules"
        (#266)
      - ensure backwards compatibility with bool filter (#218)
      - removed localhost condition as default as it could be a localhost connection.
        (#257)

      major_changes:
      - Add a role for the installation and configuration of `Icinga for Kubernetes
        <https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-for-kubernetes/latest/>`_.
      - Add tasks to role :code:`icingaweb2` to install and configure `Icinga for
        Kubernetes Web <https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-kubernetes-web/latest/doc/02-Installation/>`_.
      minor_changes:
      - Add :code:`netways.icinga.icinga2_ticket` filter. This filter converts a given
        string (NodeName) into an Icinga2 ticket using a TicketSalt.
      - Add Icinga Web 2 module :code:`Graphite`.
      - Add variable :code:`icingadb_redis_client_certificate` to define whether TLS
        client certificates are accepted/required/rejected when connecting to the
        Redis server. Only has an effect when using TLS encryption.
      release_summary: This release introduces Icinga for Kubernetes (thanks to @gianmarco-mameli),
        removes deprecation warnings present in the prior release, adds a new filter
        and support for the Graphite module.

        configuration templates now render properly based on the given TLS related
        variables.

        If using TLS in Icinga DB Redis, the non-TLS port will be disabled. The Icinga
        DB (daemon) configuration now uses the correct YAML key for both the TLS port
        and the non-TLS port.

        '
      minor_changes:
      - 'Extend condition for the API feature when using self generated certificates.

        This avoids running the given portion of the code unnecessarily.

        Thanks @thesefer'
      - For Icinga2 certificates and key file permissions are now set explicitly when
        using self generated certificates (**0644** and **0600** respectively).
      - 'The Icinga2 API feature now allows for the use of certificates already present
        on the remote host.

        This means that certificates (and the key) no longer have to be present on
        the Ansible controller

        which allows for more flexibility when it comes to certificate deployment.

        The new behavior can be activated by setting :code:`ssl_remote_source: true`

  0.4.3:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Add internal modules to installable modules list. This allows for modules
        directly shipped with Icinga Web 2 to be configurable. This mostly affects
        the :code:`monitoring` module since it has actual configuration options. Others
        like :code:`setup` can now be enabled/disabled.
      - 'Fix issue where the package for any given Icinga Web 2 module was not installed
        if that module had set :code:`enabled: false`.

        Modules are now installed and configured properly even when they are set to
        be disabled in the end.

        '
      - Fixed an issue where the :code:`config.ini` file of the :code:`monitoring`
        module was not deployed.
      - 'More complex database passwords have been an issue when importing database
        schemas. The passwords are now properly quoted using the :code:`quote` filter.

        This means that passwords containing characters such as :code:`#` and :code:`\\`
        should now work correctly.


        The change affects Icinga 2 (IDO), Icinga for Kubernetes, Icinga DB and Icinga
        Web 2.

        '
      - 'Switch from :code:`run_once: true` to :code:`throttle: 1` when applying database
        schema.

        The initial intention was to apply the schema once per cluster. However, if
        nodes are independent, e.g. multiple clusters, this would still only run on
        the first host, leaving the other node(s) with empty databases.


        The tasks are rewritten to now check whether the schema needs to be applied
        before trying to do so.

        This happens one host at a time. Thus, the tasks take slightly more time but
        work when using multiple clusters.

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - :code:`icingaweb2_roles` was not deployed at all if :code:`icingaweb2_admin_username`
        and :code:`icingaweb2_admin_password` were missing. Now for both, the predefined
        admin role and user-defined :code:`icingaweb2_roles`, the respective variables
        are tested for correctly when creating :code:`roles.ini`. Thus, the creation
        of an initial admin user is no longer strictly necessary.
      - A short example for the previously undocumented :code:`icingaweb2_roles` has
        been added.
      known_issues:
      - 'With the changes in :code:`icinga2_object` arises a problem.

        The prior directory structure within :code:`icinga2_fragments_path` (default:
        :code:`/var/tmp/icinga/`) does not fit the new approach for writing configuration
        files.

        Some paths that would become directories before are now treated as files.

        If the old directory structure is present on a remote host, deployment with
        the new method will most likely fail due to this.


        If the execution of :code:`icinga2_object` fails, deleting :code:`icinga2_fragments_path`
        should fix the problem.

        This, however, is a manual step that needs to be done.

      - 'Introduction of role :code:`ifw` - Icinga for Windows: This role allows to

      - 'The performance of the action plugin :code:`icinga2_object` has been greatly
        improved.

        Instead of writing individual objects to files and later merging them,

        they are instead now merged in memory on a per destination basis.

        This means that configuration files no longer have to be assembled after the
        fact.


        This also drops the :code:`order` parameter previously used to define the
        order in which

        objects are written if they belong to the same destination file.

        The new behavior only changes the order in the files but does not change the
        end result.


        A performance gain of up to 80% has been seen in testing.

        '
      minor_changes:
      - In the :code:`icinga2` role objects are collected from different places before
        writing them to files. Duplicates could occur which was not taken care of.
        All collected objects are now deduplicated using the :code:`unique` filter
        right before writing to save some time during execution.
      - The deb repositories made available by the :code:`repos` role now use the
        `deb822 format <https://repolib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deb822-format.html>`__.
        This can lead to APT warnings on systems that already have the repositories
        deployed using the old format (sources.list). To fix this, simply remove the
        old :code:`icinga.list` file after the repositories have been deployed in
        the new format.
      - The error messages about unsupported operating systems have been tuned. They
        should now appear if and only if the actual OS is in fact not supported instead
        of appearing after unrelated task failures.

      - Empty config directories are now cleaned up **after** config assembly within
        the :code:`icinga2` role. This should avoid leftover files from previous deployments.
      - Fix automatic determination of IfW framework path (:code:`ifw_framework_path`).
      - Fix quoting of password within mysql command for IDO database schema import.
      - Use explicit booleans in conditions inside of role :code:`monitoring_plugins`
        for compatibility with :code:`ansible-core >= 2.19`. Thanks @gianmarco-mameli
      - Using :code:`ansible.windows.win_powershell` for the :code:`Install-Icinga`
        command can sometimes get stuck and stay idle indefinitely. The according
        task now uses :code:`ansible.windows.win_shell` as this seems to be more reliable.
